- road map:
    - do.
    - references.
    - codegen.
    - unordered decls.
    - incremental.
    - modules.
    - nat literals.
    - `Of_Nat` and default impls.
    - multi-threading.
    - macros.
    - basic proof inference.
    - crates.


- todo:
    - do & brck.
        - parse refs.
        - elab do:
            - collect values, build bbir.
            - variable assignment stuff.
    - partial functions.
    - `fn`.


### issues:

- the `Add::R` explosion.
    - aka the associated type blowup.
    - aka this needs fixing.
    - consider `TermKind::Proj`.
    - we need something that reduces these terms asap.
    - in general, we don't want to reduce asap, cause it can make it harder
      to understand where terms came from.
      here, we may want to record some info (similarly for impl values,
      which are "unfolded" during impl resolution).
    - should be able to do that in `instantiate_ivars`. may still lead to
      pathological cases if the user manually specifies the impl, we'll see.
