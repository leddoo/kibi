- next steps:
    - step debugger.
    - wasm.
        - nominal structs, enums & traits, typeid.
        - better runtime errors.
    - macros, modules, multithreading.
    - error handling:
        - try operator.
        - pcall.
    - `Gc` type, `new`.
        - implicit deref/inout with methods.
        - but pass without deref.
        - so `&*` to inout boxed value?
        - compiler could do implicit stuff if has types.
        - fix gc.


- todo: step debugger.
    - scrollable codeview.
        - thinking we just do fixed point iteration again.
        - give read access to the sizes, positions & scroll offsets.
        - ig you can change the scroll offset without triggering another update, but you do need to mark the widget for rendering.
        - scrollbars should perhaps remain in the library.
        - though maybe if you have access to the content size, you'd only need one re-render when the need for a scrollbar changes.
        - todo:
            - scroll offset widget state.
                - use for hit testing / drawing.
                - read write access.
                - temp scroll buttons.
            - window scroll bar.
                - uses layout prop. -> re-render when sizes change.
    - render pcs.
        - arrows.
        - highlighting lines.
        - including dormant ones. (show "inverse depth")
        - F10.
    - partial code view.
        - probably through replacements.
    - multiple code views.
