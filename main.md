- next steps:
    - debug info.
        - better source info (eg: `ast::Block::source`, `ast::Op1::op_source`).
    - debugging.

- todo:
    - small things:
        - remove multi-ret.
        - compile cancelling operators.
        - vm: implement missing operators.
        - labeled break.
        - nil -> empty tuple.
        - fix register hints for joins.
            - just joining into stmt w/ lower stmt_index may work.
    - tuples.
        - destructuring.
        - tuple ret.
    - kbtf & validation.
    - trace logging.

- decisions to make:
    - kwargs?
    - use atomic for interrupt?
        - really not executed that often.
        - definitely not ub.

- general backlog:
    - optional args & varargs.
    - del.
    - tuples.
    - table -> map.
    - usable host api.
    - objects & methods.
        - string keys only.
    - try, catch.
        - `on_error: Option<(handler_pc, err_reg)>`.
            - set by compiler inserted instructions.
    - proper gc & memory allocation.
    - closures.
    - kbtf.
        - wasm-like transfer format.
        - unlimited registers (but limit to 127 for now).
        - later: typed registers.
            - easy to validate.
            - can be used for unchecked operations.
        - vm optimizations like inline caches are not exposed.
        - "close captures" instruction.
    - gradual typing.
    - structural structs.
        - ad-hoc structs for args/rets (works well because structural).
    - box.

- compiler backlog:
    - compile:
        - assert cfg has no critical edges.
    - validation:
        - phi maps & stmt lists uniquely owned.
        - return error instead of panicking.
    - trace logging:
        - for debugging & giving insight into what the compiler does.
    - debug info:
        - accurate source ranges.
        - local mapping.
    - no-elim stmt flag.
    - default return is empty tuple.
    - tuple return optimization.
    - parser:
        - token array.
        - remove eof token.
    - features:
        - numbers.
        - tables.
        - break, continue, return.
        - optional chaining.
    - impl-opt:
        - function::gc.
        - typed bb/stmt bit sets.
        - phi2 & call0-4.
        - track phi begin/end on bbs.
        - cssa: update terminator args.
    - tests.


- vm backlog:
    - booleans.
    - integers.
    - or_else.
    - get_field.
    - function env capture.
    - impl-opt:
        - 16 byte align `Value`.
        - generic ops: inline(always).
        - stack & instruction "pointers".
        - hash slot prediction.
        - hidden classes?
    - tests.

- low priority backlog:
    - `IfBlock` -> `ValueBlock` use for functions?
    - `_` for discarding values.

- ideas:
    - reverse debugging:
        - start with snapshots + outputs of external functions.
        - perf wise, that would be a bit like a stop-the-world gc - not ideal, but good enough, maybe.
        - cancel snapshot if there's a non-serializable host function in the call stack.
    - resumable host code:
        - enables pausing code anywhere -> preemptive multi-tasking.
        - maybe using async for ergonomics.
            - issue: future captures `&mut Vm`.
        - serializable state machine would be better.
            - no unsafe required.
            - serializable.
        - also keep non-state-machine host functions, as they're faster (require no allocation for state).
        - related: host closures.
    - fast strcmp: ptr_eq first.
    - jump tables.
    - runtime, cross-module optimizations:
        - eg: inlining.
        - can always flush the optimizations, if module is reloaded or exported function is changed.
    - typed user data.
    - instanceof instruction.
    - coverage instruction.
        - with inline counter.
    - freezing & read-only refs.
    - get/set object properties.
    - `do` block constraints:
        - restrict variable "capture": `[&a, &mut b]`.
        - if use that, can't return from outer function either. maybe.
