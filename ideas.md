- meta programming:
    - definitely want something for the gui (like jsx, but in user land).
    - want to exploit ability to run code in the compiler.
        - especially, as there's no "cross compiling".
        - and maybe serialization for state caching.
    - issue: querying for definitions of symbols.
        - 1) cause dynamic.
            - definitions could change at runtime.
            - would want to use the same info as the optimizer.
        - 2) cause unordered.
            - can't know what macro will output ~ have to constrain access to output.
            - could make macros ordered.
                - can only access definitions "above".
                - nothing above can access macro output.
                - does get a bit more complicated with imports.
                - will have to come back to this, once know how regular out-of-order analysis works here.
    - code repr:
        - thinking use `Object`s.
            - structs don't help, would have to box everything.
        - very flexible.
        - extensible.
        - structured -> walkable, editable.
        - can use proper values, instead of having to serialize them to text.
